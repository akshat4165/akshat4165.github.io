      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;static/images/Ejpt_certificate.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;eJPT Cover Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;exam-duration-and-difficulty&#34;&gt;Exam Duration and Difficulty&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently cleared the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) exam, and overall, it was a very solid learning experience. I completed the exam in about 35 hours, including sleep. While it wasn’t extremely hard to pass, I wouldn’t call it easy either. I’d place it somewhere between intermediate and hard, especially if you’re completely new to penetration testing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;static/images/EJPT.png&#34; alt=&#34;My Exam Scores&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-about-penetration-testing-than-web-apps&#34;&gt;More About Penetration Testing Than Web Apps&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that surprised me was that the exam is not very focused on web application penetration testing. There is some web-related work, but most of the exam feels more like real-world network and system-level penetration testing. You spend more time enumerating services, exploiting misconfigurations, moving through systems, and understanding how different parts of the network connect, which I personally enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
