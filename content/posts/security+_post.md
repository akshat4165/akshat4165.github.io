I’m excited to share that I’ve officially **completed my CompTIA Security+ certification!** 🎉  

### 📌 Why I took Security+
- To strengthen my fundamentals in cybersecurity.
- To improve my chances for internships.
- To gain structured knowledge in security domains.

### 💡 My Experience
The exam was challenging but rewarding. I prepared with:
- Andrew Ramdayal's Udemy Course, Jason Dion Practice Exams, my own Handwritten notes.
- Consistent study schedule alongside college.

### 🛠️ Key Learnings
Some of the most valuable areas I learned:
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs.
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**: Authentication, authorization, MFA.
- **Risk Management**: Threat modeling, vulnerability management.
- **Cryptography**: Hashing, encryption, PKI.
- **Incident Response**: Preparation, detection, containment, recovery.

### 🚀 What’s Next?
I plan to continue with a new certification i.e. INE eJPT, blogging about security, and preparing for internships in cybersecurity.
