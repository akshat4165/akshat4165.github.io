ðŸš€ **Starting My eJPT Journey!**

Iâ€™ve officially enrolled in the **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** course ðŸŽ¯  

- **Investment:** $250  
- **Target:** Complete before **November 2025**  

The eJPT is an entry-level penetration testing certification that covers network pentesting, web app basics, and exploitation methodology. Iâ€™m taking this course to strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for bug bounty hunting and more advanced certs.

### Why Iâ€™m doing this

- Build a solid foundation in penetration testing.  
- Prepare for bug bounty hunting (web focus) and certifications like eCPPT/OSCP later.  
- Learn in public â€” Iâ€™ll post updates, lessons learned, and lab writeups here.  

### What Iâ€™ll share

- Weekly progress updates and lab highlights.  
- Short writeups for interesting labs and techniques.  
- Tools and resources I found useful.  

If youâ€™ve taken eJPT or are preparing, Iâ€™d love your tips! ðŸ™Œ
