Hi, I'm **Akshat Agarwal**, a cybersecurity enthusiast and BCA (Hons.) student at **Christ University, Bangalore, India**.  
I’m currently studying for the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, and this blog is where I document my journey — from tutorials and notes to projects and practical cybersecurity insights.

This platform is also part of my effort to build a strong profile for applying to internships in cybersecurity.  
If you’re a beginner, a fellow learner, or a recruiter — you’re in the right place.
