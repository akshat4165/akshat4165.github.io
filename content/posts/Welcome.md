Hi, I'm **Akshat Agarwal**, a cybersecurity enthusiast and BCA (Hons.) student at **Christ University, Bangalore, India**.  
I’m currently studying for the **CompTIA Security+ certification**, and this blog is where I document my journey — from tutorials and notes to projects and practical cybersecurity insights.

This platform is also part of my effort to build a strong profile for applying to internships in cybersecurity.  
If you’re a beginner, a fellow learner, or a recruiter — you’re in the right place.

## 🔜 Coming Soon

**First project dropping soon:**  
🕵️‍♂️ “Reconnaissance 101: Mapping a Real Network Using Nmap, theHarvester & Shodan”

I'll walk you through how I used OSINT tools to ethically gather public information about a real organization — mapping open ports, subdomains, emails, and exposed services.

Whether you're a beginner or prepping for Security+, this project will help you understand how attackers think — and how defenders can reduce their footprint.

🧰 Tools Used: Nmap, theHarvester, DNSDumpster, Shodan
📊 Deliverables: Full step-by-step guide, screenshots, GitHub repo, and blog write-up
📚 Learning Outcomes: Real-world reconnaissance skills, ethical awareness, and network mapping
